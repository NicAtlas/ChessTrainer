            for the center and creates an imbalanced position. It's known for leading to sharp, tactical play and is favored 
            by players who like to play for a win with Black. Many World Champions have relied on the Sicilian Defense.

            of the center. Despite its name, it's not a true gambit as Black cannot safely keep the pawn. The Queen's Gambit

            and c4, then challenges it with piece pressure. It's known for leading to complex positions with opposite-side 
            attacks. Many aggressive players, including Garry Kasparov, have used it successfully at the highest levels.
